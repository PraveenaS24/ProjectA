      this.title=title; // this.title is global variable, and title is a local variable
 title=filmtitle;// This is similar to this.title=filmtitle, but using this. prefix is not compulsory
   director=filmdirector;// This is similar to this.director=filmdirector but using this. prefix is not compulsory
    as there are no local variables by name title, or director 
   so, here they will implicitly referred to global variable
   note: if title and director are not globally declare then it will be undeclared variable cannot be resolved to a variable
    if the parameter names are similar to the global variables 
    then there is an ambiguity between the local variable (parameters) and global varaible
     hence this. prefix is used for referring the global variable 
    will be referring the local variable on both side of the = operator (x=x)self assigning

   Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean: the container instantiates, configures, decorates and otherwise assembles a prototype object, hands it to the client and then has no further knowledge of that prototype instance. For releasing resources try to implement a custom bean post processor.
